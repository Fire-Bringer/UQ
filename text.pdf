## Why are they needed

## Good activity

But what makes a good activity? Ideally, teachers need icebreakers that are low in social risk,  matched to your class’s proficiency level, and perhaps just a bit silly. A good activity will encourage bonding, participation, motivation, and allow students to relax both mentally and physically. Of course, it’s an added bonus if they can be easily adapted as warm ups or speaking activities during the year.
